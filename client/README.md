This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this application we have set up two components that we wired up in the App.js file.

The Fib component is going to attempt to fetch information from the fetch api & show it on the screen. It also can take input from user and send new indexes that need to be posted/calculated to the backened

To build: `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`
To run build: `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 <CONTAINER_ID>`
